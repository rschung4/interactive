## Interview

**You’re the biggest fan of chocolate I know. What’s your favorite memory of chocolate?**

When I was a freshman in high school, I began studying chocolate because I had just gone to a chocolate pairing with various fruits and cheeses. A few chefs and local business owners in my hometown, Sebastopol, ran the event. I remember trying to cook something really creative: a chocolate cake. [laughs]
It was so cool to see all the ways chocolate was being used: one chef even made an ox tail chocolate soup. Chocolate really brought all these different people and foods together in one space. 

**How did chocolate influence your studies now and how has it stayed with you in your life?**

Chocolate was the starting point for my career, as it is today. It was what got me into botany and into plants in general. I always had a passing interest in the environment, but chocolate is really what got me into plant biology and botany in particular. Since then my interests have morphed, I do a lot of ecological work, particularly in the savanna. But right now, I’m in an archeology course about Aztec history, largely because of the civilization’s role in chocolate. I have a huge soft spot for chocolate still, and it remains a large interest of mine. 

**Is that why you’ve decided to give the plant a permanent place on your body?

I got my second tattoo, this flower, from the Theobroma cacao tree, which is quite meaningful for me because chocolate is so central to my career and my interests today. It has had quite a large impact on my life in a weird way. 

It’s also such a cool flower; the growth of the Theobroma cacao tree is unique, it requires a very special pollinator. The flower is beautiful. It’s something that I want to stick with me forever and a tattoo is how that manifested!
