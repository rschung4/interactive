## “Interview”

**You’re the biggest fan of chocolate I know. What’s your favorite memory of chocolate?**

When I was a freshman in high school, I began studying chocolate because I had gone to a chocolate pairing with different fruits and cheeses. A few chefs and local business owners in my hometown, Sebastopol, California ran the event. I went and I tried to do something really creative: a chocolate cake. But ever
it was so cool to see the different ways chocolate was being used: one made an ox tail chocolate soup and some other creative dishes it was cool: chocolate brought all these different people and foods together in one space. 

**How did chocolate influence your studies now and how has it stayed with you in your life?**

Chocolate was the starting point for my career, as it is today. It was what got me into botany and into plants in general. I had had always a passing interest in the environment in general, but chocolate is really what got me into plant biology and botany in particular. Since then my interests have morphed, I do a lot of ecological work, particularly in the savannah. I’m in an archeology course about Aztec history, largely because of the civilization’s role in chocolate. I have a huge soft spot for chocolate still, and it remains a large interest of mine.
