<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">I think so. But nothing wrong on your side. It will be just a minor thing i can handle.

Please focus on your health and school life which mom and i support.

I have been in bad cold this week and off Thu. Please watch out your health.

Always love.</marquee>
