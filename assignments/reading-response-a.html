Nilas: Someone told me that my undergraduate teacher once used one of my projects for her teaching. I
actually really didn't like that teacher—we had a bad relationship—so I think that's weird that she's allowed
to show my work. I had no control over the work that was made at the school. The school legally owns it.

Matt: That's the case with most universities, right? With most archives, once you give your work to the
institution, you've relinquished the ability to sort of go back in and edit or touch.

Ayham: I don't know what it’s like here, but at my undergraduate art school they made it explicit to us that
they have the right to keep the work if they want as well as to document it, catalog it, preserve it, and
publish it.

Nate Pyper: I think that's a good question, too. What do we give up when we archive or when we compile
our archives? We think about the bureaucracy and structures that have come before and are built to carry
permission but don’t necessarily have our best interests in mind. When is it appropriate to resist the
archive?
