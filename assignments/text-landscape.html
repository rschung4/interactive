  <div id="welfare"><span><p> I want a president with no air-conditioning, a president who has stood in line at the clinic, at the DMV, at the welfare office, and has been unemployed and laid off and sexually harassed and gaybashed and deported. I want someone who has spent the night in the tombs and had a cross burned on their lawn and survived rape. I want someone who has been in love and been hurt, who respects sex, who has made mistakes and learned from them. I want a Black woman for president. I want someone with bad teeth and an attitude, someone who has eaten that nasty hospital food, someone who crossdresses and has done drugs and been in therapy.</p></span></div>

  <p> I want someone who has committed civil disobedience.</p>

  <p>And I want to know why this isn’t possible.</p>

  <p> I want to know why we started learning somewhere down the line that a president is always a clown.</p>

  <p>Always a john and never a hooker.</p>
  <p>Always a boss and never a worker.</p>

  <p>Always a liar, always a thief, and never caught.</p>
